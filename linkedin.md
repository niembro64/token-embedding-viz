**Ever wondered what words look like when they hang out together?**

I built a 3D visualization of word embeddings, and honestly, the results are both fascinating and slightly unhinged.

Here's what I learned:

**"italy" is to "pasta" as "japan" is to... "ramen"?**
The math actually works. Words have directions. My brain hurts.

**"boy" is to "girl" as "man" is to...**
Yep, the model figured that one out too. 50-dimensional space compressed into something my monkey brain can rotate with a mouse.

**"run" is to "ran" as "walk" is to...**
Past tense has a *direction* in vector space. Let that sink in.

The spheres you see? They show how confident we can be about the "answer" - smaller sphere = closer match = the AI is less confused than I am.

**Tech stack for the curious:**
- Vue 3 + TypeScript (because I like types and pain)
- Three.js (making WebGL almost enjoyable since 2010)
- PCA dimensionality reduction (turning 50D into 3D without crying)
- GloVe embeddings (Stanford's gift to NLP nerds)
- Spring physics for animations (because linear interpolation is for quitters)

The wildest part? These relationships emerge from just reading a LOT of text. No one taught the model that Italy loves pasta. It just... noticed.

Sometimes AI feels less like magic and more like a very attentive student who read the entire internet and took notes.

**What word analogies would you want to see?**
